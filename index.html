However, there were still many opportunities to pursue drama in prepatory school. Each year there would be audtitions for musicals such as Dr Dolittle, I have auditioned since Grade 3 when only 4 kids were allowed to participate. Furthermore, during music lessons we tend to learn new instruments and compose songs on our own.</p>

Moreover, Design Technology is a subject that not many schools teach, however, Kellett chooses to give this subject to students to inspire them to be more creative. In DT, I have made things such as a bluetooth speaker, jewelry, and a cup on Fusion.</p>

                  <h4>Journalist</h4>
                  <p>Being a journalist of the Junior Herald is a gargantuan honor that I am grateful to have been chosen for. I first sent two pieces of writing to see if they liked it and they did! I will cherish my moments as a student reporter and will always remember the articles that I have written. All my articles that have been published are to the best of my ability and I'm proud of the journalist and writer I have become from it.</p>

                  <p>Helping those in need is what being a Kellett Cares representative is all about. Kellett Cares is my school's fundraising club where we select a charity to support at the start of the year and work to raising as much money and awareness as possible. This was a good opportunity for me to help others and collaborate with people that I would normally not talk to.</p>

                  <p>At the end of the 2018 to 2019 academic year, I was awarded with the effort & progess award. This was a honor considering that we had approximately 50 students in my year group. The process for the nomination is when the teachers who teach the particular year group puts a name forward and others have to vote for one student. To this day, I treasure this award and am proud of what I have achieved in order to earn it.</p>

                    <p>Over the years I have actively participated in my school soccer team as well as, joining clubs outside my school community. Since I was in Year 3 I started to play soccer and ever since then, I have enjoyed playing this sport more than anything. Every year I am always apart of my school's soccer team, when in Year 4 we were allowed to form a team within our year group I was moved up to the age group above. I have joined many teams outside of school too! The teams are KCC, HKIS, and The Hong Kong Football Club. I will always be grateful for the many opportunities and life skills I have been taught by playing soccer.</p>

                    <p>Horse-riding has had a bigger impact on my life over these recent years. Since I started riding I have gone to Clearwater Bay Equestrian Center and have had a livery on a range of different ponies and horses. Since joining CEEC, I have become part of the competition team that regularly goes out for competitions. Not only am I a part of the CEEC team, I have competed for my school team since I was of the age limit. Horse-riding has provided me with experiences that will last me a lifetime. More recently, my new livery is a young horse, Pepper, that needs to be further trained. I am grateful for all the friends and instructors that have taught me lessons, both in riding and in life.</p>

                    <h4>Annual Cambodia Volunteering</h4>
                    <p>Over the years, I have become more and more invested in helping the people of Cambodia, more specifically, the schools. Education is important for children, as a result, I have worked with The Ponheary Ly Foundation and Missione Possible to help the children and families of Cambodia in need. Due to this experience, I have visited schools in both Siem Reap and Phnom Penh to help and fundraise for these organizations. A few years ago, I came up with the idea to sell baked goods to raise money, later, my friend and I went around her mother's office and raised a hefty amount of money. This money was later used to buy the children books and toys. My volunteering in Cambodia has taught me many things and I am proud to be sponcering a little girl in Phnom Penh through Missione Possible.</p>

                    <p>Since I was in Year 2, I have found a fondness for music and singing, therefore, I have since been apart of the school choir. It has been my honor to perform in numerous celebrations, such as the annual Christmas Show. Due to choir, I have been exposed to many opportunities like, auditioning and performing in the FOBISIA Music Festival. Choir is joyful and has exposed me to new opportunities and allowed me to meet new people.</p>
