                  <p>In English, we learn poetry, William Shakespeare's plays, and we end our academic year by choosing a book and analyzing the text. This way I can earn a deeper understanding of a range of different topics and learn to engage in class in different ways.</p>

                  <p>Maths is a subject where I have been taught a range of different skill sets and applied them to daily life. Currently, I have learnt pre-algebra, algebra one, and algebra two. However, my school curriculum likes to vary our content and go on a rotation between numbers, algebra, shape & space, and data.</p>

                  <p>Biology, Chemistry, and Physics were first introduced to my cirriculum when I entered secondary school. Since then, we have been rotating topics each year and have been tested of our knowledge by having tests at the end of each topic.</p>

                  <p>Geography was first introduced as a separate subject when I entered secondary school, since then we have covered topics such as tourism and climate change. Although geography is essentially embeded in history, we learn such things as contour lines that we wouldn't otherwise.</p>

                <div id="tab-5" role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane">
                  <p>History at my school is very much focused on British history, as a result, I have learnt about the Industrial Revolution, Opium Wars, the Australian Convict Colony, and Slavery. However, I have much more topics in previous years, we learn to write analytical essays and look at a range of different sources to justify our point.</p>

                  <p>Chinese becomes mandatory in our school cirriculum when we enter into Grade 1, therefore, I have built up my Chinese skills for a long time. The regular subjects that we cover in a year are colours, clothes, travel, transport, weather, and tourism. Although we often repeat these topics every year, each year we expand our understanding in that particular area and we enhance our ability to speak and write about these topics.</p>

                  <p>Whilst music and drama are closely linked to one another, music was introduced to us when we entered school and drama was introduced when we entered secondary school. However, there were still many opportunities to pursue drama in prepatory school. Each year there would be audtitions for musicals such as Dr Dolittle, I have auditioned since Grade 3 when only 4 kids were allowed to participate. Furthermore, during music lessons we tend to learn new instruments and compose songs on our own.</p>

                  <p>Vibrant, symbolic, and meaningful. I have studied art as a subject since entering Kellett School and since then, I have covered numerous different topics. We have focused on areas such as tone, photography, sketching, and design. Moreover, Design Technology is a subject that not many schools teach, however, Kellett chooses to give this subject to students to inspire them to be more creative. In DT, I have made things such as a bluetooth speaker, jewelry, and a cup on Fusion.</p>

The process for the nomination is when the teachers who teach the particular year group puts a name forward and others have to vote for one student.
